  summary: During my time at American University, I was a teaching assistant for two computer science classes, where I held office hours 
        for homework, graded work, and provided feedback to students. I also held other leadership positions, such as holding the PR chair for 
        AU's Association of Computing Machinery and the Asian American Student Union. I was also the web editor for our investigative journalism magazine, 
        American Way of Life, where I oversaw our migration and redesign of our website.
